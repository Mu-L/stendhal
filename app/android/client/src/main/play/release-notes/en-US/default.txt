The world has just gotten a little fancier. You may notice that the clouds have cleared in Kikareukin, revealing a beautiful view of Semos below.

If luck has it, you may find a rare four-leaf clover. Keep your eyes peeled, they pop up in random locations that receive sunshine. Clover hunters will reward generously for such valuable trinkets.
